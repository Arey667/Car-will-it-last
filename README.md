# Used Cars- Predict cars are more likely to become ‘INSURANCE SALVAGED’

**United States sells many used cars each year.  Used cars are sold under 2 classifications: ‘CLEAN’, and ‘INSURANCE SALVAGED’.  Vehicles that are salvaged are because of various reasons:**
- accidents:  involved in high # of accidents or major accidents caused by driver or car mechanics
- damaged:  water damage, flooding
- age:  value has diminished below bluebook, repairing is not worth the cost
Insurance companies would benefit in knowing if there are certain vehicle features which would make cars more prone to ending a cars clean title early.
I will use this ‘classification’ feature to determine if there are ‘features’ within the data that can help predict if a car will become the casualty of ‘INSURANCE SALVAGED’.
